Current problems: 

Dying works, but not very well.

Features missing: Triple combos with cat cards along with the rest of the cat cards, a few more actions need try/except and shuffle cards.

Version 0.1
- Added Attacks.

Version 0.5
- Hopefully for the final time, reworked nopes.
- Added the basis for cat cards, probably shouldn't release now but fixing nopes took SOOO long.

Version 0.6
- After going absolutely insane trying to figure out how the cards were deleted after being played, I have now learnt that they were never being deleted, so I added that...

Version 0.7
- Added two cat cards, Tacocat and Beard Cat.
    - At the moment, cat cards can only be played in double combos.
- FIXED NOPES FOR THE LAST TIME.
- The endless stream of QOL goes on and on...
