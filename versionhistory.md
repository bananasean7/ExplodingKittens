Current problems: 

Dying works, but not very well.

Only three cards.

Playing cards feels weird as you have to remember positions.



Version 1.0
- Added Skips and Favors.
- Released Project.


Version 1.1
- Added Attacks.
- Added try/except blocks to stop the project ending when you misinput.
- Added text upon using cards.
- Reworked turn ending systems, now you can take an amount of turns at once instead of having tookturn = True/False.
