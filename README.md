If you do not know how to play exploding kittens, here is a short description:

Basically, it's russian roulette, with kittens. 
You pick up a card, and if it's an exploding kitten, you either play a defuse (which is like your revive) or you die.
There are a few cards that help you avoid the exploding kitten in the game right now:

Skip: Skip your turn.

Favor: Other player gives you a card of THEIR choice.

Attack: Ends your turn and makes the other player have to take TWO turns.

See the future: Lets you view the top THREE cards of the deck.

Nope: Cancels the effect of the MOST RECENTLY played card.

Cat cards (Tacocat and Beard cat):
Cat cards are powerless on their own, but can be played in a pair or a trio to perform a double combo or a triple combo:
- Double combo: Takes a RANDOM card from the other player's hand.
- Triple combo: YOU name a card, and if they have it, they must give it to you, and if they don't, you receive NOTHING.

Thanks for reading and let me know if you find any bugs or have suggestions.
